```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ ls
lecture1
[user@sahara ~]$ cat


^C
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
1. cd is intended to change dirctories, since we did not specify which directory, it will go to (or stay as) default home directory
2. ls prints the folders in the directory which only has lecture1.
3. cat leads to an error as nothing is printed
